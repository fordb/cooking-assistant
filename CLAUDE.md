# Documentation & Progress Tracking

## Session Documentation (REQUIRED)
At the start of each session:
1. Read `docs/current-work.md` to understand current context
2. Update `docs/session-notes.md` with new session header
3. Set clear goals for the session

During development:
1. Update `docs/session-notes.md` with progress after each major task
2. Note any discoveries, issues, or decisions in real-time
3. Update `docs/current-work.md` when changing files or status

At the end of each session:
1. Summarize accomplishments in `docs/session-notes.md`
2. Update `docs/current-work.md` with current state
3. Add key insights to `docs/progress-log.md` if significant

## Documentation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive headers
- Include timestamps for major updates
- Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
- Note any trade-offs or alternative approaches considered
- Keep technical details at appropriate level for future context

## File Management
- Keep `docs/session-notes.md` current and active
- Archive completed sessions to bottom of file
- Update `docs/current-work.md` before ending sessions
- Add weekly summaries to `docs/progress-log.md`

# Bash commands
- To add!

# Workflow
- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
