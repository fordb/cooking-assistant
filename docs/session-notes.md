- [14:50] Updated CLAUDE.md to document git integration for tying commits to session work

### Session Summary
**Accomplishments:**
- Fixed documentation workflow gap where progress-log.md wasn't being updated consistently
- Implemented systematic `/end-session` command to ensure all CLAUDE.md requirements are met
- Created git pre-commit hook (.git/hooks/pre-commit) to tie documentation workflow to commit process
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with better workflow integration and git documentation requirements

**Issues Encountered:**
- Initial confusion about why progress-log.md wasn't being updated - discovered need for more systematic approach
- Required creating additional tooling (end-session.md) to ensure compliance with existing documentation standards

**Session Complete: 2025-07-24 Documentation Workflow Improvements**
