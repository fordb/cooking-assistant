- Replace print statements throughout codebase with proper logging
- Implement standardized logging with appropriate severity levels
- Improve scalability and debugging capabilities

### Progress
- [14:00] ✅ Created comprehensive logging configuration system (LoggingConfig dataclass)
- [14:15] ✅ Implemented centralized logging setup with console and file handlers
- [14:30] ✅ Replaced print statements in main.py with appropriate logging levels
- [14:45] ✅ Updated src/conversation_memory.py with logging for preference updates
- [15:00] ✅ Converted debug prints in src/query_classifier.py and src/meta_prompting.py to logging
- [15:15] ✅ Added logging to evaluations files while preserving user output prints
- [15:30] ✅ Created comprehensive logging tests and verified all 86 tests still pass
- [15:45] ✅ Verified end-to-end logging functionality with console and file output

### Session Summary
**Accomplishments:**
- **Complete Logging System Implementation**: Built comprehensive logging infrastructure to replace print statements
  - LoggingConfig dataclass with environment variable support
  - Centralized setup_logging() function with console and file handlers
  - Log rotation support (10MB max, 5 backups)
  - Hierarchical logger naming (cooking_assistant.module.function)
  - Different log levels for console (INFO) vs file (DEBUG)
- **Strategic Print Statement Replacement**: Replaced 74+ print statements across 7 files
  - System messages converted to appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
  - User interface prints preserved for direct user interaction
  - Progress indicators converted to INFO level
  - Error handling upgraded to ERROR level with stack traces
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added 4 new logging tests to config test suite
- **Production Ready**: All 86 tests pass with no functionality regressions

**Technical Implementation:**
- `src/config.py`: LoggingConfig dataclass with setup_logging() and get_logger() functions
- `main.py`: Strategic logging for session tracking, strategy selection, and error handling
- `src/conversation_memory.py`: User preference update logging
- `src/query_classifier.py` & `src/meta_prompting.py`: Demo function logging
- `evaluations/`: Progress tracking and system operation logging
- Log format: "[timestamp] - [level] - [module] - [function:line] - [message]"

**Quality Metrics:**
- 74+ print statements strategically replaced with logging
- 86 tests passing (100% pass rate maintained)
- 4 new logging configuration tests added
- File and console logging working with proper rotation
- Environment variable configuration support

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **Scalability**: Configurable log levels and destinations for different environments
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive system behavior tracking with timestamps and source locations
- **Production Ready**: Professional logging with rotation and monitoring integration
- **Standardization**: Consistent logging format across entire application
- **Maintainability**: Centralized logging configuration with environment overrides

**Files Updated:**
- src/config.py (LoggingConfig + setup functions)
- main.py (session and error logging)
- src/conversation_memory.py (preference tracking)
- src/query_classifier.py (demo logging)
- src/meta_prompting.py (demo logging) 
- evaluations/evaluator.py (progress logging)
- evaluations/run_eval.py (evaluation tracking)
- evaluations/results.py (system operation logging)
- tests/test_config.py (logging tests added)

**Impact:**
This logging implementation transforms the codebase from scattered print statements to a professional, scalable logging system. The application now provides proper system monitoring, debugging capabilities, and production-ready logging infrastructure while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Session Complete: 2025-07-27 Logging Implementation**

  - Collection configuration (name, embedding dimensions)
  - Search parameters (similarity threshold, result limits)
  - OpenAI embedding model configuration
  - Environment variable override support
- [15:00] ✅ Integrated VectorConfig into main configuration system
- [15:15] ✅ Created Docker Compose configuration for local Chroma setup
- [15:30] ✅ Built test script (test_chroma_connection.py) for connection verification
- [15:45] ✅ Created startup script (start_vector_db.sh) for easy database initialization
- [16:00] ✅ Installed and verified chromadb library integration
- [16:15] ✅ Created data/chroma_db persistence directory
- [16:30] ✅ All infrastructure components ready for vector database operations
