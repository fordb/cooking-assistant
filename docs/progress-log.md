# Progress Log

*Long-term tracking of major milestones and key insights*

## Week of 2025-07-22

### 2025-07-24 - Project Initialization
- **Milestone**: Documentation system established
- **Key Insight**: Implemented session tracking workflow with automated reminders
- **Impact**: Sets foundation for consistent progress tracking across all development sessions
- **Next**: Ready to begin actual cooking assistant development

### 2025-07-24 - Documentation Workflow Enhancement  
- **Milestone**: Fixed documentation compliance gap with systematic tooling
- **Key Insight**: Manual documentation workflows need systematic enforcement mechanisms
- **Decision**: Created `/end-session` slash command and git pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent compliance
- **Impact**: Transforms documentation from manual checklist to automated workflow integration
- **Trade-off**: Added slight overhead to session closure, but ensures comprehensive tracking
- **Next**: Test workflow in practice and refine based on usage patterns

### 2025-07-24 - Recipe Dataset Foundation
- **Milestone**: Created comprehensive recipe dataset with 15 diverse examples
- **Key Insight**: Dataset diversity is crucial for AI training - variety in cuisines, difficulty, timing, and meal types provides rich examples for pattern learning
- **Decision**: Balanced representation across difficulty levels (7 Beginner, 6 Intermediate, 1 Advanced) to support users at all skill levels
- **Impact**: Provides solid foundation for cooking assistant features with realistic, tested recipes spanning 6 cuisines and all meal types
- **Quality Focus**: Emphasized detailed, actionable instructions with specific measurements and timing for practical usability
- **Next**: Integrate dataset with cooking assistant features and test real-world usage patterns

### 2025-07-24 - Documentation System Validation
- **Activity**: End-session documentation verification
- **Finding**: Documentation workflow is functioning correctly - all prior work properly captured
- **Status**: System ready for next development phase with comprehensive tracking in place

### 2025-07-24 - Recipe Generation Quality Control System
- **Milestone**: Implemented comprehensive validation system for AI-generated recipes
- **Key Insight**: Quality control is essential for AI-generated content - validation prevents malformed or unrealistic recipes from reaching users
- **Technical Achievement**: Created two-tier validation: critical structure validation (raises errors) and measurement warnings (provides feedback)
- **Decision**: Integrated validation directly into generation pipeline rather than post-processing to fail fast and provide immediate feedback
- **Impact**: Ensures all generated recipes meet minimum quality standards and consistency with example dataset
- **Quality Metrics**: Validates 1-20 servings, positive timing, min 2 ingredients, min 3 steps, realistic measurements
- **Trade-off**: Added slight latency to generation process but significantly improves output reliability
- **Next**: Test validation system with real generation scenarios and refine rules based on edge cases

### 2025-07-24 - Comprehensive Unit Testing Foundation
- **Milestone**: Established complete unit testing infrastructure with 20 tests covering all functionality
- **Key Insight**: Testing foundation is critical before expanding features - prevents regressions and ensures reliability as complexity grows
- **Technical Achievement**: Created 4 test files covering models, examples, validation, and generation with 100% pass rate
- **Decision**: Integrated testing into git workflow via pre-commit hooks rather than relying on manual execution
- **Architecture Choice**: Used mocking for external dependencies (OpenAI API) to enable isolated, fast unit tests
- **Impact**: Provides confidence for continued development with automated quality assurance
- **Quality Metrics**: 20 tests across 4 modules, edge case coverage, error condition validation, integration testing
- **Trade-off**: Initial time investment in test setup pays dividends in development velocity and code reliability
- **Documentation Integration**: Added comprehensive testing section to CLAUDE.md with commands, structure, and workflow
- **Automation**: Pre-commit hook prevents commits with failing tests, ensuring main branch quality
- **Next**: Expand test coverage as new features are added, consider integration testing for full workflows
