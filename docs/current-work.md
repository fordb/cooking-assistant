# Current Work Status

## Current State
- Project: Cooking Assistant (early setup phase)
- Documentation system initialized per CLAUDE.md requirements
- Git repo initialized with basic file structure

## Active Files
- data/example_recipes.json - Expanded to 15 diverse recipes covering multiple cuisines and difficulty levels
- main.py - **ENHANCED**: Added prompt template integration with test_prompt_templates() and show_template_usage() functions
- src/examples.py - Recipe loading functionality
- src/output_validator.py - Recipe validation system with structure and measurement checking
- src/recipe_generator.py - Enhanced with validation integration and error handling
- src/prompts.py - **COMPLETE**: Full prompt template system with 5 template types and select_prompt_template function
- tests/ - **EXPANDED**: Comprehensive unit test suite with 35 tests across 5 files:
  - tests/test_models.py - Recipe model validation and edge cases (7 tests)
  - tests/test_examples.py - Example loading and formatting (5 tests)
  - tests/test_output_validator.py - Structure and measurement validation (4 tests)
  - tests/test_recipe_generator.py - Generation with mocked API calls (4 tests)
  - tests/test_prompts.py - **NEW**: Prompt template system testing (15 tests)
- CLAUDE.md - Enhanced with testing section and workflow integration
- end-session.md - Slash command for systematic session closure
- .git/hooks/pre-commit - Enhanced git hook with automated test execution
- Documentation tracking system active and improved

## Dataset Status
- Recipe count: 15 recipes (expanded from 3)
- Cuisine diversity: Italian, Mexican, Asian, Greek, American, Indian
- Difficulty distribution: 7 Beginner, 6 Intermediate, 1 Advanced
- Meal type coverage: Breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert options
- Time range: 5-minute prep to 8-hour cooking times
- All recipes include detailed ingredients, instructions, timing, and serving information

## Recent Development
- **Validation System**: Implemented comprehensive recipe validation to ensure quality and consistency
- **Quality Control**: Added bounds checking, measurement validation, and error handling
- **Generation Pipeline**: Recipe generation now includes validation steps before returning results
- **Unit Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage with 20 tests across all modules
- **Testing Integration**: Automated test execution via pre-commit hooks and clear documentation

## Testing Status
- **Test Coverage**: 35 unit tests across 5 test files (100% pass rate)
- **Recent Addition**: 15 new prompt template tests covering all template types
- **Automation**: Pre-commit hook runs tests before each commit
- **Documentation**: Complete testing instructions in CLAUDE.md
- **Quality Assurance**: Tests cover core functionality, edge cases, and error conditions

## Next Steps
- Test recipe generation with validation system end-to-end
- Consider expanding validation rules based on usage patterns
- Test recipe data integration with cooking assistant features
- Consider adding recipe categorization or search functionality
- Begin development of core assistant features using expanded recipe dataset
- Add integration tests for complete recipe generation workflow
